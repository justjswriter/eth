## Project Title: Smart Contract for Receiving and Managing Ether

### Project Description
This project involves the creation and deployment of a smart contract that:
- Receives Ether tokens.
- Allows the contract owner to withdraw all Ether from the contract balance.
- Provides a function to check the contract's current balance.

The project also integrates the smart contract with a blockchain environment using **web3.js** and demonstrates interaction with it via scripts and tools like Ganache and Metamask.

## Features
1. **Smart Contract Functionalities**:
   - Ability to receive Ether using the `receive` function.
   - Secure withdrawal of the contract balance by the owner.
   - Real-time contract balance checking.

2. **Integration with Web3.js**:
   - Configured to connect with Ganache or a public testnet.
   - Script to interact with smart contract functions.

3. **Blockchain Environment Configuration**:
   - Ganache local blockchain.
   - Metamask configured for interaction.
